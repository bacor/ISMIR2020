# Figure 1

Shown is the beginning of a responsory for  Candlemas, 
[*Beata es Maria quae dominum*](http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/chant/603452), 
from a twelfth-century manuscript 
([D-KNd 1161](http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/source/601861)),
"possibly written for use by the female abbey of Saint Mechtern in Cologne".
There was no particular reason for choosing this example.
